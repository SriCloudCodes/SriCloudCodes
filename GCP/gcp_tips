        Cloud Computing services
            IAAS
            PAAS
            SAAS

IAAS Example
Some of the examples of services provided under IAAS by Google Cloud are IPs, Firewalls, Storage, Virtual Private Cloud, Compute Engine.

PAAS Example 
Examples of PAAS in Google Cloud are Google App Engine, which is their first service, BigQuery, Cloud SQL, Cloud PubSub, etc.

SAAS:

 Google Apps like Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and many more are hosted on Google Cloud, which are examples of SAAS. Google Cloud Platform is a backbone for any software as a service product you want to develop

cloud computing is an environment that needs various types of virtualization.


        Virtualization (Logical Separation of Process)
            Server Virtualization
            Storage Virtualization
            Network Virtualization


Storage services are scalable, and in IAAS services, they are scaled according to the requirements without any extra service tickets to cloud providers.

After carrying out all the virtualization tasks, cloud providers also provide different cabilities that are not possible or are time-consuming on local infrastructure.

Google Cloud Facts and  Special charectrisitics:
Secure Global Private Network.
Only Cloud Provicers with all the network data goes only through their Private network .. No public network involved. 
 
**  TensorFlow is one of these technologies. TensorFlow was Google’s AI engine and was at the core of their Google Search. Now, it is open-sourced and anyone can use it for Machine Learning purposes.	

** VM Live Migration only provided by google as of today's date. In other cloud providers VMs has to stop for the migration. 

** Creators of Kuberenetes Engine and OPen Sourced now.. Millions of Containers running for Google Services using Google's Kubernetes Serivice.

** AI and Machine Learning Services
	Kubeflow is trending for ML ops now. Again, KubeFlow was based on Google’s internal method to deploy TensorFlow models to Kubernetes, called TensorFlow Extended.


Organized Structure Spl Info:
Google Cloud also offers lifetime-free resources. Check out cloud.google.com/free.
Proven Google apps and services like maps that are hosted on Google Cloud.
Google Cloud data centers run on half the energy of a typical data center and run on 100% renewable energy when available.

Organization:
================
If you are not using G-Suite, Cloud Identity and Cloud Directory Sync services help you to use the other Active Directory services to manage your Google Cloud account.

o
These services help keep users in the active directory in sync with Google Cloud.

All GCP services except IAM and Billing should belong to any of the GCP Project.

IAM and Billing are organizational level services.

IAM -- Identity and Access Management -- Who can access what on Which Resources.

End Lever Resources/ Serivices :examples: VM instance, Storage Bucket.

 			Inheritence:
			===========


Grant the storage Object Admin role to your data processing expert Alice at alice@example.com, for example. Alice has object admin rights at the project level and can read, add, and delete any object in any bucket in the project.

Grant the Storage Object Creator to a group of users, data_uploaders@example.com. This policy means that anyone who is a member of data_uploaders@example.com can upload files to the bucket. A group member owns the files that they upload, but they can’t read or delete any files that other users upload. The following diagram illustrates this

Project has Three Attributes:
============================
Project Name , Project ID, Project Number

Project ID is unique ID.

Project Number is also unique but assigned by GCP.

IAM -- 
       Identity and Access Management

GCP Service and Resource Example : Service is Compute and Resource is instance 

Permission & Roles:
		Permisssoin are building blocks of IAM 
Set of Permissions are assigned for Roles
 

Permissionas are template type and created by Google and not modifi

We can create a role but not permissions.
IAM has three type os Roles

Primitive Roles
Predefined Roles
Custom Roles 

Primitve Roles:
		Like Super User having lot of permissions

Caution: Basic roles include thousands of permissions across all Google Cloud services. In production environments, do not grant basic roles unless there is no alternative. Instead, grant the most limited predefined roles or custom roles that meet your needs.

Predefined roles #

Google Cloud has already created the most frequently used organization roles. These are specific to resources. Consider Compute Admin. This role is defined as compute.instanceAdmin and has multiple permissions bundled inside it.

Customer Roles#
		One thing to note is that custom roles cannot be applied at the folder level.

Custom roles are a great way to provide permission to a newly created or unconventional role in an organization. However, these roles need to be managed by the organization or anyone who has this responsibility.

Keep in mind that GCP does not manage custom roles, and you need to take care of those.

The format of a permission is service.resource.verb. For example, the compute.instances.stop permission will manage stopping a VM.

Other IAM Components :
======================
				IAM Members and POlicy

IAM Members:
		“A member can be a Google Account (for end-users), a service account (for apps and virtual machines), a Google group, or a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity domain that can access a resource. The identity of a member is an email address associated with a user, service account, or Google group; or a domain name associated with Google Workspace or Cloud Identity domains”


Members of IAM can be:

    Google Account: Anyone with Gmail ID can be given access to the project or specific resources.

    Service Account: This is internal to GCP. A service account acts as an identity for the services. For example, if we want to restrict a particular virtual machine from accessing any resources, we can remove all the roles and permissions associated with the virtual machine’s service account.

    Google Groups: Often, you might want to assign the same permissions to a set of users or a team. Google groups help to satisfy this requirement. When the permissions are assigned to a Google group email ID, we can add and remove users to that group who need those permissions.

    Cloud Identity Domain: These are email IDs with organization domains, like abc@educative.io. If an organization is not using Google Workspaces, this organization’s user emails are given access to GCP using the Cloud Identity service.

    Google Workspaces Domain: If an organization is using G-Suite to manage their organization’s email and other company-wide services, these user IDs are Google Workspaces IDs. These are automatically synced with the organization’s GCP account.

Apart from these, there are two predefined keywords that represent a certain type of member.

    allAuthenticatedUsers: The value allAuthenticatedUsers is a special identifier that represents all service accounts and all users on the internet who have authenticated with a Google account. This identifier includes accounts that aren’t connected to a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity domain, such as personal Gmail accounts. Users who aren’t authenticated, such as anonymous visitors, aren’t included.

    allUsers: The value allUsers is a special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet, including authenticated and unauthenticated users.

So, now that you know how many types of users are in GCP, let’s look at “how” to control these members’ access to services using IAM.


IAM policy #

IAM policy is created whenever a role or permission is granted to a user. An IAM policy is represented by the IAM policy object. An IAM policy object consists of a list of bindings. A binding binds a list of members to a role.

IAM Hands-On
================
		In this lesson, we will explore Cloud IAM using GUI and cloud shell. (Google Cloud Ephemeral Shell Environment.) This demo requires more than one user in your GCP project, so we will create a second user in our current project.

Storage Bucket created for Testing: my_st_new_file in Project GCP-Learning

Service Account created with Storage object Bucket View Permission and verfied it on the Google Cloud shell . 
Cloud shell Initializtion with the User:
=======================================
    gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=[path/to/keyfile.json
    gcloud config set account [email]
	gcloud ml-engine jobs list

		gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=
		gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=gcp-learning-316611-470728fa1cc3.json
Bucket List from Cloud Shell:
============================
gsutil ls gs://[bucketname]

 ****Enabling APIs 
===================

In GCP, every service is available as an API. Some APIs are enabled by default when we create a project. For the rest of the services, we need to first enable the API to use them.

API explorer to tyo try before enabling the APIs .

					Billing Accounts
Creating a new account for each procjec is good idea to maintain and track the billing. 
BigQuery methond is advisible for the new trend of tracking the billing in GCP.

				Comput Service 
				==============

Comput Options:

        Use of App Engine
        Use of Cloud functions

        Use of GKE
        Use of Cloud Run

        Use of Compute Engine



Compute, Storage and Networking are 3 core pillars of Cloud computing.

Compute Services offered by GCP:
    Compute Engine
    Google Kubernetes Engine
    App Engine
    Cloud Run
    Cloud Functions
    VMware Engine

Above service can be chosen based on Operations managed by us and workload on the compute engine.

Use of App Engine #

App Engine is a fully managed platform. It is used to deploy a web-based application and mobile backends. The reason it is listed as a limited workload is it supports applications that speak only HTTP. Also, it supports specific programming languages only and a custom runtime needs to be created with Docker.

This will be used when:

    You don’t want to do operations and just want to focus fully on development.

    You don’t care about the OS.

    You want high availability of the app across geographic locations.

    Application portability is not your concern.

    Your app communicates over HTTP.

Use of Cloud functions #

Cloud functions are an event-triggered piece of code. The code is executed based on some event. And that’s the reason it useful for some more workloads as compared to App Engine. Hence, located lower side of the workload axis.

This will be used when:

    You want to accomplish something using code after an event is triggered. For example, when an image is uploaded, you want to compress that image and store it on cloud storage.

    You can develop in Javascript, Go, Python3 and JAVA

    You don’t care about OS.

    The functionality is time-bound. This means the code execution should not exceed 540 seconds.

Use of GKE #

Google Kubernetes Engine is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Google. GKE can run different workloads as long as they are containerized. GKE doesn’t require you to manage the low-level configurations like OS. However, you need to define the clusters and their operations.

So, you use GKE when:

    You have containerized workload.

    Your focus is on containers.

    You want portability like you can migrate your app to other cloud providers if needed.

    You think containers as a unit of deployment.

Use of Cloud Run #

Cloud run is the managed GKE service. The use case mostly same as GKE except,

    You are not worried about portability.

    You want Google to manage cluster creation.

    Your workloads are containerized.

    You want to be charged as little as possible. (Free 2 million requests per month in the specific US region)

    You care about high availability of the app

    You don’t care about the underlying OS or networking.

Use of Compute Engine #

The last service the Compute Engine is suitable for all type of workloads, it’s a high performance and provides OS-level access. However, with great power comes great responsibilities.

So, you use Compute Engine when:

    You want control over low-level specifications such as CPU, GPU, RAM, OS, storage, networking etc. Like configuring a computer.

    You want to lift and shift the existing app as it is.

    No containerized workloads.

    Bulk processing and require short-lived compute instances. (Preemptible instances.)

					GKE Google Kubernetes Engine

Terms #

Let’s understand the common terms of Kubernetes.

    Pod: Pod is the smallest unit of deployment on Kubernetes. A pod can have multiple containers running inside it. These containers run and scale together and share Pod IP. Basically, the pod is a copy of our application.

    Node: A Node is an actual VM instance. Docker and Kubernetes are preinstalled in these machines. Pods are run inside the machine. Depending upon the configuration a node can have multiple or single pod running at a time in it.

    Services: Services are the endpoint for users. These are interfaces between a pod and the world. As the pod IP can change when a pod is restarted, the Service allows us to map our deployments to a specific endpoint.

    Deployment: A deployment is a definition of the pod. A pod contains container and container is a code. So code can fail and that leads to the pod failure. So, the deployment has the number replicas of a pod in it and it is the responsibility of deployment to maintain the mentioned number of pods in the cluster up and running.

    Daemonset: This type of controller is used to run Node level configurations. Daemonset makes sure that a copy of specific software runs on each node. For example, monitoring agents or New relic.

    Secrets: Secret is the mechanism for storing sensitive data. We can pass on the sensitive data to the container at runtime using an environment variable or by mounting the data in a volume.

    Configmaps: It is similar to secrets except it is used to store non-sensitive configurations of the code. This can also be accessed at runtime by a container.

 GKE -- Management and operations are done by the Google .. 
         Only we need to use the containers..
